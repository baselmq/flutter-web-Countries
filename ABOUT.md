Reason for choosing flutter

1-Simple to learn and use
Flutter is a modern framework, and you can feel it! It’s way simpler to create mobile applications with it.
I personally never liked mobile application development before I started using Flutter.
What I love about Flutter is that you can create a real native application without a bunch of code.


2-Quick compilation: maximum productivity
Thanks to Flutter, you can change your code and see the results in real-time. It’s called Hot-Reload. It only takes a short amount of time after you save to update the application itself.

3-Flutter has a robust community
